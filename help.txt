Examples: 

Segment addressess:
0-4FF,1000-4000 = direct addresses
@500 = Read segment address from $500
0-2@ = From beginning of file to 2 bytes from end of file

@500<2 Offset: -2
@500>2 Offset: +2
@500:2  2 bytes
@500:4  4 bytes
@500*4	4 pairs of Dword Start - End 	
@500:2*4  4 pair of Word Start - End

Segment search:
 * Segment addresses:
2000-4000,4000-6000	Select segment area, where search matches
 * Search for:
a5a0:3c:y	Match if found a5a0 from segment start + 3c
a5a0:3c:n	Match if NOT found a5a0 from segment start + 3c
a5a0:3c:y,a5a0:4c:y	Multiple searches, first match matters

Checksum & info addressess:
#0:2:Hex = Beginning of segment, word, show as Hex
#4:2:Int = 4 bytes from segment start, Word, Show as integer
#8:4:Text = 8 bytes from segment start, Dword, show as text

Extrainfo:
InfoName:#8:2:hex
InfoName:FFFE:4:int
Info1:#8:2:hex,Info2:FBA,Info3:#0
PN:CW1-64:4:int, Serial:CW2-80:12:text		CW = Checkword address, see "Checkword locations" and "Checkword"


Checkwords:
a5a0:88:88:CW1		Search A5A0 from 0x88 (from segment start) and if found CW1 points to segment start + 88
a5a0:88:0:CW2		Search A5A0 from 0x88 (from segment start) and if found CW2 points to segment start
a5a0:88:88:CW1,a5a0:88:0:CW2,a5a0:56:0:CW3,a5a0:56:56:CW4	Multiple checkwords
